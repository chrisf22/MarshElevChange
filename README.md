The goal of this analysis is to synthesize datasets and data types on marsh elevation change to obtain estimates and uncertainty bounds at multiple spatial scales. The scripts in STAN pseudo-code are for a hierarchical model that makes it possible to infer trends at any spatial scale – e.g. patch, complex, geomorphic setting, and region – while accounting for uncertainty in the estimates at all other scales. This model also allows estimates to be fed into the model while incorporating the error associated with field measurements. The scripts are for models with increasing complexity, starting with a test version that uses generated data to quantify any bias associated with the model structure and patterns of missing data.
